<h3>
Carbohydrates
</h3>

<p>
Carbohydrates are an important group of foods for fueling your muscles.
Carbs are partially converted to glycogen, which is a form
of energy stored in muscles. This energy helps to power your workouts.
 Men and women need about half of their calories from carbohydrates per
 day but, if you are trying to bulk up then you should be eating about
  4-7 grams of carbs per every kilogram of body weight
</p>

<h3>
Protein
</h3>

<p>
Protein is a macronutrient that is essential to building muscle mass.
 It is commonly found in animal products but also found in other foods such as beans, eggs, nuts, and milk.
  When pushing your body to the limit by straining your muscles it's important to be
   getting the right amount of protein to build that muscle when it starts reforming. If your goal is to develop muscle
    then you should be eating 0.5 to 1 grams of protein daily.

<h3>
Fats (Good and Bad)
</h3>
<img src="fat.jpg" alt="foods that contain good fats">
<p>
Fat helps give your body energy, protects your organs, supports cell growth, keeps cholesterol and blood pressure under control,
 and helps your body absorb vital nutrients. Although it is essential to eat fats especially when upping your workout routine,
  there are both good and bad fats that affect you differently. Eating good fats in place of saturated fat lowers the “bad” LDL cholesterol,
   and it improves the ratio of total cholesterol to “good” HDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart disease.
    Eating good fats in place of saturated fat can also help prevent insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes.
     Bad fats such as saturated fats raise the level of unhealthy cholesterol in your blood. This puts you at a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.
      As a general guideline, fat should make up 20 to 35% of your total calories. For overall health and muscle strength, focus on sources of heart-healthy fats
