<h3>
Carbohydrates
</h3>

<p>
Carbohydrates are an important group of foods for fueling your muscles.
Carbs are partially converted to glycogen, which is a form
of energy stored in muscles. This energy helps to power your workouts.
 Men and women need about half of their calories from carbohydrates per
 day but, if you are trying to bulk up then you should be eating about
  4-7 grams of carbs per every kilogram of body weight
</p>

<h3>
Protein
</h3>

<p>
Protein is a macronutrient that is essential to building muscle mass.
 It is commonly found in animal products but also found in other foods such as beans, eggs, nuts, and milk.
  When pushing your body to the limit by straining your muscles it's important to be
   getting the right amount of protein to build that muscle when it starts reforming. If your goal is to develop muscle
    then you should be eating 0.5 to 1 grams of protein daily.
